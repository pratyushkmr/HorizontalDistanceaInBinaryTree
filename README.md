# HorizontalDistanceaInBinaryTree
Given a binary tree, find the horizontal distance between 2 nodes at the same level, also counting the position where the node is not present. For Example, in the given tree, the distance between node 7 and 1 which are at same level is 2 (considering right child of node 2 and left child of node 3)
